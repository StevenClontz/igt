  <title>Non-Zero-Sum Games</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous chapters we concentrated on zero-sum games. We know how to solve any zero-sum game. If it has a pure strategy equilibrium, then we know the players should play the equilibrium strategies. If it doesn't have an equilibrium point, then we have seen methods for finding a mixed strategy equilibrium. Assuming both players are our model rational players, then we know they should always play an equilibrium strategy.

      In this chapter we turn our attention to non-zero-sum games.
