<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Each player chooses a number 1-5. If the two numbers don't differ by 1, then each player adds their own number to their score. If the two numbers differ by 1, then the player with the <em class="emphasis">lower</em> number adds <em class="emphasis">both</em> numbers to his or her score; the player with the higher number gets nothing. (From Douglas Hofstadter's <span class="booktitle">Metamagical Themas</span>.)</div> <div class="para">For example, suppose in round one Player 1 chooses 4; Player 2 chooses 4. Each player keeps their own number. The score is now 4-4. In the next round, Player 1 chooses 2, Player 2 chooses 5. The score would now be 6-9. In the third round Player 1 chooses 4, Player 2 chooses 5. Now Player 1 gets both numbers, making the score 15-9.</div></article></body>
