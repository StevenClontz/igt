<div class="para">Let's make a few important observations. First, it should be clear from the graph that Player 1 expects a payoff of 1/2 NO MATTER WHAT PLAYER 2 DOES. Furthermore, since this is a zero-sum game, we know that Player 2's expected payoff is <span class="process-math">\(-1/2\text{.}\)</span> It is important to note that this graph does not give us any information about an optimal strategy for Player 2. We will see how to find a strategy for Player 2 in the following exercises. Can you think of how you might do this?</div>
