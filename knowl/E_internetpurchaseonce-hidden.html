<body class="ignore-math"><article class="exercise exercise-like"><div class="para">Suppose the above matrix represents the situation of purchasing an item (say, a used textbook) on the internet where both parties are untraceable. You agree to send the money at the same time that the seller agrees to send the book. Then we can think of Cooperating as each of you sending money/ book, and Defecting as not sending money/ book.
