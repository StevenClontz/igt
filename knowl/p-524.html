<div class="para">We now have a new method for finding the best mixed strategies for Players 1 and 2, assuming that each player is playing defensively against an ideal player. But how can we find the value of the game? For Player 2, we assumed <span class="process-math">\(E_1(H)=E_1(T)\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we found the situation in which Player 1's expected value is the same no matter which pure strategy she plays. Thus, Player 1 is <em class="emphasis">indifferent</em> to which pure strategy she plays. If she were not indifferent, then she would play the strategy with a higher expected value. But, as we saw, this would be bad for Player 2. So Player 1 can assume that Player 2 will play the equilibrium mixed strategy. Thus, as long as Player 1 plays a mixed strategy, it doesn't matter whether at any given time, she plays H or T (this is the idea that she is indifferent to them). Hence, the expected value of the game for Player 1 is the same as <span class="process-math">\(E_1(H)\text{,}\)</span> which is the same as <span class="process-math">\(E_1(T)\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, we find that the expected value of the game for Player 2 is <span class="process-math">\(E_2(H)\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(E_2(T)\)</span>). This is a pretty complicated idea. You may need to think about it for a while. In the meantime, use the probabilities you found for each player and the equations for <span class="process-math">\(E_1(H)\)</span> and  <span class="process-math">\(E_2(H)\)</span> to find the value of the game for each player.</div>
