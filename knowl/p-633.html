<div class="para">You have now solved a rather complex two-person game. Try playing it with your friends and family. It may be difficult (or even impossible) to play randomly with the exact probabilties. It is also unlikely that your opponent will also be playing the equilibrium strategy, but can you use the solution to assure an advantage, or at least assure that your opponent doensn't have an advantage? Can you see the difference between an exact theoretical solution to a game, and a practical strategy for playing the game? In the next chapter we will see even more differences between theoretical and practical solutions to a game.</div>
