<div class="para">Two partners in crime are arrested for burglary and sent to separate rooms. They are each offered a deal: if they confess and rat on their partner, they will receive a reduced sentence. So if one confesses and the other doesn't, the confessor only gets 3 months in prison, while the partner serves 10 years. If both confess, then they each get 8 years. However, if neither confess, there isn't enough evidence, and each gets just one year. We can represent the situation with the matrix in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_PrisonersDilemma.html" title="Table 4.2.8">TableÂ 4.2.8</a>.</div>
