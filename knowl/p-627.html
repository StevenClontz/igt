<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/E_symmetricpayoff.html" title="Exercise 3.7.13: Expected payoff for a symmetric game">ExerciseÂ 3.7.13</a>, you should have determined that since this is a symmetric game, the expected value for each Player should be 0. Modify your equations to include this piece of information. It is important to recognize that this step greatly simplifies our work for the expected value method since we don't need to set the expected values equal to each other. HOWEVER, we can ONLY do this since we know the game is symmetric!</div>
