<div class="para">Now we want to know what Player 1's payoff will be as she varies the probability, <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> with which she plays <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> We can draw a graph where the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis represents to probability with which she plays B (<span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>) and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis represents the expected payoff (<span class="process-math">\(m\)</span>). Thus, when Player 1 plays only <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> she is playing <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> with probability 0; when Player 1 plays only B, she is playing B with probability 1. It might be easier to remember if you label your graph as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_MixedStrategyAxes.html" title="Figure 3.2.3">FigureÂ 3.2.3</a>.</div>
