<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">One example of a Volunteer's Dilemma is the game where everyone chooses “1 point” or “5 points.” If at least one person writes down 1 point, then everyone gets the number of points they wrote down. If no one chooses 1 point, then everyone gets 0 points. Choosing “1 point” is considered volunteering or cooperating. Choosing to not volunteer and take “5 points” is defecting.</div> <div class="para">You should note that it is difficult to put this game into a matrix form since payoffs depend on whether there is at least one volunteer or cooperator.</div></article></body>
