<div class="para">Now it may have occurred to you that since this is a zero-sum game, we could have just converted our matrix to the payoff matrix for Player 2, and found Player 2's maximin strategy. But it is important to understand the relationship between the maximin and the minimax strategies. So for the sake of practice and a little more insight, find Player 2's maximin strategy by writing the payoff matrix for Player 2 and repeating the process that we did for Player 1. Keep in mind that Player 2 is finding the probability of playing <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> rather than <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>
