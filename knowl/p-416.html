<div class="para">We now know that Player 2 wants to play the minimax strategy in response to Player 1's maximin strategy, so we need to find the actual mixed strategy for Player 2 to employ. Since we are minimizing Player 1's maximum expected payoff, we will continue to use the matrix representing Player 1's payoff. We will repeat the process we used for Player 1, except the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis now represents the probability that Player 2 will play <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> and the lines will represent Player 1's strategies <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis continues to represent Player 1's payoff.</div>
