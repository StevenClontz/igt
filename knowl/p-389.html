<div class="para">Find the probability (<span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>) and payoff (<span class="process-math">\(m\)</span>) if Player 1 always plays <em class="emphasis">A</em>. If Player 1 plays pure strategy A, then she never plays B. Thus the probability she plays B is 0. Hence,  <span class="process-math">\(p=0\text{.}\)</span> In the case where Player 1 plays A and Player 2 plays C, what is the payoff to Player 1? This is <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(m=1\text{.}\)</span> Thus, for the strategy pair <span class="process-math">\([A, C]\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\((p, m)\text{.}\)</span> It is important to note that <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a payoff vector. This is common notation for any ordered pair. With payoff vectors, the ordered pair represents the payoff to each player. Here the ordered pair represents a probability of playing B and the payoff to Player 1.</div>
