<div class="para">Consider a poker game in which each player comes to the game with $100. If there are five players, then the sum of money for all five players is always $500. At any give time during the game, a particular player may have more than $100, but then another player must have less than $100. One player's win is another player's loss.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_IntroZeroSum.html#poker" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
