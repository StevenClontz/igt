<div class="para">Before moving on, let's again, make sure we understand what this line represents. Any point on it represents the expected payoff to Player 1 as she varies her strategy, <em class="emphasis">assuming Player 2 only plays <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span></em>. In this case, we can see that as she plays <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> more often, her expected payoff goes down. You can now use this Sage cell to plot any line for Player 2's pure strategy <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> Just edit the values for the points <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> Go ahead and try it! (Don't worry the original values will reset when you refresh the page.)</div>
