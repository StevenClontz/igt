<em class="emphasis">Answer:</em> You might say since there are four suits, and one of the suits is hearts, you have a probability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}\text{.}\)</span> You'd be correct, but be careful with this reasoning. This works because each suit has the same number of cards, so each suit is <em class="emphasis">equally likely</em>. Another way the calculate the probability is to count the number of hearts (13) divided by the number of cards (52). Thus, we get a probability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}=0.25\text{.}\)</span>
