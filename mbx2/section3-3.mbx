  <p>
    In this section, we will use the idea of expected value to find the equilibrium mixed strategies for repeated two-person zero-sum games.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the significant drawbacks of the graphical solution from the previous section is that it can only solve 2 X 2 matrix games. If each player has 3 options, we would need to graph in three dimensions. Technically this is possible, but rather complicated. If each player has more than 3 options, since we can't graph in four or more dimensions, we are at a complete loss. So we need to think about an alternate way to solve for the mixed strategies. Although we will begin with 2 X 2 games, this method will easily generalize to larger games.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the game called <em>Matching Pennies:</em><index><main>Matching Pennies</main></index> each player can choose HEADS (H) or TAILS (T); if the two players match, Player 1 wins; if the two players differ, Player 2 wins.

        Since we know that there is no pure strategy equilibrium point, we need to look for a mixed strategy equilibrium point. Just by looking at the payoff matrix, what do you think an ideal strategy for each player would be? Explain your choice.

  <p>
    We could use our previous graphical method to determine the expected value of the game (you might quickly try this just to verify your prediction). However, as we have noted, a major drawback of the graphical solution is that if our players have 3 (or more) options, then we would need to graph an equation in 3 (or more!) variables; which (I hope you agree) we don't want to do. Although we will continue to focus on <m>2 \times 2</m> games, we will develop a new method which can more easily be used to solve to larger games.

    We will need a little notation. Let

      <mrow>P_1(H) \amp  = \mbox{ the probability that Player 1 plays H; }</mrow>
      <mrow>P_1(T) \amp  = \mbox{ the probability that Player 1 plays T;}</mrow>
      <mrow>P_2(H) \amp  = \mbox{ the probability that Player 2 plays H; }</mrow>

  <exercise xml:id="E_mpP2_60_40">

      Suppose Player 2 plays H 60<percent /> of the time and T 40<percent /> of the time.

        <li><p>
            We can use expected value to compute what Player 1 should do in response to Player 2's 60/40 strategy. First, consider a pure strategy for Player 1. Compute the expected value for Player 1 if she only plays H (call it <m>E_1(H)</m>) while Player 2 plays H with probability .6  and T with probability .4.
          </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Similarly, compute the expected value for Player 1 if she plays only T (call it <m>E_1(T)</m>).

            Which pure strategy has a higher expected value for Player 1? If Player 1 plays this pure strategy, will she do better that your predicted value of the game?

    Since we now know that Player 2 wants <m>E_1(H)=E_1(T)</m>, we can use a little algebra to compute the best defensive strategy for Player 2. Remember, we want to assume that Player 1 will always be able to chose the strategy that will be best for her, and thus Player 2 wants to protect himself. Let's find the probabilities with which Player 2 should play H and T.

    We now have a new method for finding the best mixed strategies for Players 1 and 2, assuming that each player is playing defensively against an ideal player. But how can we find the value of the game? For Player 2, we assumed <m>E_1(H)=E_1(T)</m>. In other words, we found the situation in which Player 1's expected value is the same no matter which pure strategy she plays. Thus, Player 1 is <em>indifferent</em> to which pure strategy she plays. If she were not indifferent, then she would play the strategy with a higher expected value. But, as we saw, this would be bad for Player 2. So Player 1 can assume that Player 2 will play the equilibrium mixed strategy. Thus, as long as Player 1 plays a mixed strategy, it doesn't matter whether at any given time, she plays H or T (this is the idea that she is indifferent to them). Hence, the expected value of the game for Player 1 is the same as <m>E_1(H)</m>, which is the same as <m>E_1(T)</m>. Similarly, we find that the expected value of the game for Player 2 is <m>E_2(H)</m> (or <m>E_2(T)</m>). This is a pretty complicated idea. You may need to think about it for a while.
